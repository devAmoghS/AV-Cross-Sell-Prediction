Just like **medical insurance**, there is **vehicle insurance** where every year customer needs to pay a **premium** of certain amount to insurance provider company so that in case of unfortunate accident by the vehicle, the insurance provider company will provide a compensation **(called ‘sum assured’)** to the customer.  

# Objective
Building a model to predict **whether a customer would be interested in Vehicle Insurance** is extremely helpful for the company because it can then accordingly plan its communication strategy to reach out to those customers and optimise its business model and revenue.
